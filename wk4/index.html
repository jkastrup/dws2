					<p class="content featarticle">Valve created arguably the best first-person shooter experience with their epic release of Half-Life in 1998. With seamless narrative and impeccable gameplay, Half-Life was an immediate succes among critics and gamers. Although most have played or least heard one of their friends go on about Half-Life or other games in the series, there is always a special place in my heart for Valve and the gems it gives to the world. The game takes players on a sci-fi adventure told like no other. Starting as Gordan Freeman in a physics research facility, Black Mesa, players are instantly dropped in an expansive world filled with goofy easter eggs (like overcooking a co-worker's food in the microwave until it explodes) and plenty of surprises around every corner. After arriving at work for what seems like a normal day, Gordan's first experiment goes incredibly wrong. It is up to the player to survive and escape the inter-dimensional invaders and the armed forces called in to clean up the mess.</p>
					<p class="content featarticle">The story of Half-Life is intense to say the least. From betrayal to interdimensional invaders, there is literally nothing this game doesn't have. What's even better is that it is woven together in a way that creates an incredibly unique experience for the player, more than likely leaving them speechless by the end of the game (possibly due to the complexity of the plot). Beloved characters are plentiful, allowing every gamer to find their personal favorite. Many of these characters make appearences in the later games of the series, some definitely more prominent in the story than others. But it is this massive background of character development and plot that helped make Half-Life the classic FPS that it is. The game developers refused to explicitly give gamers what characters were feeling, or what they were thinking, but instead relied upon proper story-telling techniques to give players a chance to figure it out for themselves. This mystery, at least for me, is what has kept me tied down to the series like a 30 year old marriage: incredibly happy with what I have, but scared and excited that I might not actually be ready for what might come in the future.</p>

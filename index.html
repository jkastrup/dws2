						<h2><em>This Week's Featured Game Review</em></h2>
						<h2>Half-Life</h2>

					<p>Valve created arguably the best first-person shooter experience with their epic release of Half-Life in 1998.  With seamless narrative and impeccable gameplay, Half-Life was an immediate succes among critics and gamers.  Although most have played or least heard one of their friends go on about Half-Life or other games in the series, there is always a special place in my heart for Valve and the gems it gives to the world.</p>
					<p>The game takes players on a sci-fi adventure told like no other.  Starting as Gordan Freeman in a physics research facility, Black Mesa, players are instantly dropped in an expansive world filled with goofy easter eggs (like overcooking a co-worker's food in the microwave until it explodes) and plenty of surprises around every corner.  After arriving at work for what seems like a normal day, Gordan's first experiment goes incredibly wrong.  It is up to the player to survive and escape the inter-dimensional invaders and the armed forces called in to clean up the mess.  </p>

					<h3>Gameplay</h3>
					<p>Half-Life is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike its peers at the time, Half-Life used scripted sequences, such as a Vortigaunt ramming down a door, to advance major plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, Half-Life's story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences, keeping the player in control of the first-person viewpoint. In line with this, the game has no cut-scenes, and the player rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees "through his eyes" for the entire length of the game. Half-Life has no "levels"; it instead divides the game by chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous, except for breaks for loading </p>
					<p>The game regularly integrates puzzles, such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts, or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to. Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning on a steam valve to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few "bosses" in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the "boss".  </p>
					
					<h3>Story</h3>
					<p>Dr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility. He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen the lab has ever worked with. He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a "resonance cascade", opening a portal between Earth and another dimension.</p>
